# Chapter 10 - Deep Learning Basics

And there it is - the hype topic number one - deep learning. The authors give a short introduction to deep learning and I really liked, how firstly a single neuron is explained and then the network is built up step by step.
Additionally, the table containing the different activation functions is really valuable for me. The backpropagation algorithm and common problems with neural networks are explained.
Lastly, different types of neural networks are explained shortly.

This is a conceptual chapter and in the next chapter we are going to use the new insights to build a neural network classifier. :)
