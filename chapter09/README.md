# Chapter 9 - Visualizing Malware Trends

This chapter deals with visualization methods for malware trends. The first visualizations are done with matplotlib and the more complex ones are done with seaborn.
Additionally, a short introduction to the pandas-framework is given.

In my programming part I focused on the visualizations which were given as an example and I put them together in a jupyter notebook.
I wasn't creative enough to come up with some exiting new plots and mainly wanted to reproduce the authors' results.
