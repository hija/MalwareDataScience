# Chapter 12 - Becoming a Data Scientist

This is the last chapter of this book and it explains the path of becoming a data scientist. Additionally, the daily life is explained and some key skills for data scientists are mentioned: **Open-Mindedness, Boundless Curiosity, Obsession with Results and Skepticism of Results**.

### My personal résumé
Although some chapters were a bit of a repetition for me, I gained some insights on how malware detection works and how data science helps to identify potential threats in the future.
Especially the tools like the pefile-package for python, the strings command or the cuckoo sandbox were really interesting for me.
I think, it's clear that a book with 250 pages cannot explain malware analysis, deep learning or data science in depth, but the overview and the hands-on results were really encouraging for me.
