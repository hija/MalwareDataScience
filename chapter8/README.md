# Chapter 8 - Building Machine Learning Detectors

And there we go: Our first real machine learning malware detection. This time I switched over to Ubuntu, because I did not want to download malicious software on my windows computer.
Another change is, that I am using a jupyter notebook now, because my program is more a "story" than a real malware detector command line utility.

I am using the same approach as the authors of the book, but I am using balanced classweights (to overcome the skewed data) and additionally a normal decision tree classifier.

So go ahead and check it out - you find the jupyter notebook in this directory.

The data comes from [the official website of the book](https://www.malwaredatascience.com/code-and-data).
