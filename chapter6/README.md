# Chapter 6 - Understanding Machine Learning-Based Malware Detectors

The sixth chapter introduces (supervised) machine learning and explains how data quality, feature extraction and the right machine learning algorithm influence the malware detector.
As algorithms, the Logistic Regression, k-Nearest-Neighbour and a decision tree (and even Random Forest), are introduced. Additionally, underfitting and overfitting is explained.

Since I know these algorithms already quite good, I decided to not implement anything in this chapter. However, you can head over to my ![Machine Learning Notebooks](https://github.com/hija/MLNotebooks) if you want to see some of my small machine learning projects.
