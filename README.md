# Malware Data Science - Reading Diary
This repository contains my take-aways, coding projects and thoughts from the book **Malware Data Science** by **Joshua Saxe and Hillary Sanders**.
The book was published by the no starch press in fall 2018 and deals with analyzing malware with the help of data science methods.

For every chapter, I provide a small summary and for the most chapters I also provide some short codesnippet or jupyter notebook which I worked on to deepen my understanding of the topic.
There are the following chapters:

1. Basic Static Malware Analysis
2. Beyond Basic Static Analysis: X86 Disassembly
3. A Brief Introduction to Dynamic Analysis
4. Identifying Attack Campaigns Using Malware Networks
5. Shared Code Analysis
6. Understanding Machine Learning-Based Malware Detectors (You can read this chapter for free ![here](https://nostarch.com/download/MalwareDataScience_ch6.pdf))
7. Evaluating Malware Detection Systems
8. Building Machine Learning Detectors
9. Visualizing Malware Trends
10. Deep Learning Basics
11. Building A Neural Network Malware Detector With Keras
12. Becoming a Data Scientist + My personal résumé
