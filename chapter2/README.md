# Chapter 2 - Beyond Basic Static Analysis: X86 Disassembly

In this chapter, assembler and the process of disassembling a file was explained.
I just rushed through the chapter, since I did some assembler work with Ollydbg in the past and I had a lecture about computer systems in university :)

Thus, there is no coding task here for me :)
