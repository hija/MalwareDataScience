# Chapter 1 - Basic Static Malware Analysis

This chapter deals with the Windows Portable Exectuable (PE) file format and how to analyze this.
In particular, ...

* ... the analysis with pefile (python) for section/import/export analysis
* ... strings (unix) for retrieving strings used in the program and 
* ... wrestool for retrieving images used in the PE file is explained.

## My coding project: PEFile Analyzer with Python
I worked on analyzing PEFiles with pefile for python. I implemented my project using, contrary to the book, python 3.
This is how it works

    python PEFileAnalyzer.py "League of Legends installer EUW.exe" --sections --imports --exports

--sections, --imports and --exports are optional arguments. If you pass no argument, no real anaysis happens - the analyzer just checks if the file is a PE file.
