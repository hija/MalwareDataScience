# Chapter 7 - Evaluating Malware Detection Systems

Now we reached the second half of the book, we go more into detail about malware detection. This is another conceptual chapter, so again no coding challenge :)
The concept of Receiver Operating Characteristic is introduced.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic compares the true positive rate with the false positive rate.

Additionally, two terms have been introduces:

**Base rate** -- Percentage of Binaries that are actually malware. The base rate influences the precision.

**Precision** -- True positive rate x base rate / (True positive rate x base rate + False negative rate x (1-base rate)), i.e. how many of the alarms of the system are actually justified?

Since this was again a conceptual chapter, there is no programming task :)
