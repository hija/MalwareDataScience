# Chapter 3 - A brief introduction to dynamic analysis
The third chapter deals with the dynamic analysis, which requires running the malware in a safe and isolated environment in order to analyze its real behaviour.
A huge advantage of this method is, that you can "see" what the malware does, without having to look into the assembler code, which might be very obfuscated.
However, there are of course some malware which are not prone to this analysis, i.e. by realizing they are running in a sandbox.

Unfortunately, malwr.com is not back online (yet). I think, I will get back to this, once the website is back up again. An alternative is to run Cuckoo Sandbox, but for now I don't want to install virtualbox on my system (greetings from docker) :)
