# Chapter 11 - Building A Neural Network Malware Detector With Keras

This is the last hands-on chapter of the book and we are going to build a malware detection using deep learning. Specifically, we are using keras to build our model.
I took the same data and preprocessing as in chapter 9, because I was curious to see, how deep learning compares to random forest.
The results are quite good and even with a very simple neural network I achieve good results.

One idea might be to not only using a train/test splitup, but also a validation set, too. Then we could use early stopping to prevent overfitting.

You can find my results in the jupyter notebook again :)
